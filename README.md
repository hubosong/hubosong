Hi! My name is Hu 胡博嵩 from Brazil (🇧🇷). I currently work as Front-End Developer. I'm passionate about technology.

In my free time I like to study languagens (🇨🇳 🇺🇸), to watch movies (🎞️), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about world with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
