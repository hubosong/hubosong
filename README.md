Hi! My name is Hu 胡博嵩 from Brazil. I currently work as Front-End Developer. I'm passionate about technology.

In my free time I like to study languages as Mandarin and English, to watch movies (📼), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about world with a beer (🍺) and pizza (🍕).

Would you like to find me?
